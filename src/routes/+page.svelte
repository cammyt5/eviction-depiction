    <h3>Corporate Ownership â‰  Evictions</h3>
    <p>Let's investigate the link between corporate ownership and evictions in Boston using a dataset of Boston evictions between 2020-2023 on the <span class="text-tooltip" data-tooltip="Roughly neighborhood-sized chunks of the city.">census tract level</span>.</p>
    <p>First, we must define a few terms: in our analysis, we define the <em>eviction rate</em> in a given census tract to be the <em>annual number of evictions filed</em> divided by the <span class="text-tooltip" data-tooltip="Determined by multiplying the census tract population by one minus the tract's owner-occupancy rate."><em>renter population</em></span>.
        
    <p>The natural first step is to compare the <em>corporate ownership rate</em> to the <em>eviction rate</em> in each census tracts. However, the resulting graph does demonstrate any obvious corrolation:</p>

    <div class="viz-placeholder">ownership rate vs. evictions scatterplot</div>

    <p>That's because we're comparing apples to oranges: evictions happen at a distinct point in time, while the corporate ownership rate is the result of decades of compounded investment in an area. A better measure to compare against is the <em>corporate buy rate</em>, or the percentage of properties purchased by a business:</p>

    <div class="viz-placeholder">buy rate vs. evicions scatterplot</div>

    <p>These dynamics play out in geographically across Boston: areas of the city with high eviction rates also tend to have a higher corporate buy rate. Move the slider to filter neighborhoods by corporate buy rate - the higher the corporate buy rate, the more likely the neighborhood also has a high eviction rate.</p>
